# pero.properties

The core of most of the classes within the *pero* library is a specific implementation of properties and their
collections. This allows to specify properties not only by a final value but dynamically, i.e. as a function to retrieve
the final value from given data source. In addition, it allows for type checking or internal conversion from multiple
definition styles (e.g. for colors).
