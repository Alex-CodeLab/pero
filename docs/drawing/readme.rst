pero.drawing
============

Although the actual drawing is always done by particular backend, the main benefit of the *pero* library is its unified
drawing experience (or API), which is independent of any backend. To draw simple shapes or texts, several methods are
available for each backend's canvas implementation. For more complex drawings a path, Bezier curves and transformation
matrix can be used. Beside the main functionality, the *pero.drawing* module provides a hand full of predefined glyphs
and graphics, starting from simple markers, arrows or grids and going up to more complex graphics such as graph axes.
